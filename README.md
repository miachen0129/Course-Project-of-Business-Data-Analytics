**_Comprehensive Evaluation Model for Master’s Degree Thesis: A Method Based on Feature Mining and Text Analysis_**

## Project Overview

This project proposes an evaluation framework for Master’s thesis reviews by combining **unsupervised topic modeling**, **aspect-based sentiment analysis**, and **statistical consistency testing**. The goal is to assess whether review texts and numerical ratings are aligned and to provide objective recommendations for thesis grading.

## Key Features

- **Unsupervised and supervised Topic Modeling**  
  Used to automatically extract the discussion focus in the review texts, using both supervised and unsupervies methods, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation and imporved K-means.

- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**  
  Identifies sentiment orientation towards specific aspects such as writing quality, innovation, or methodology.

- **Statistical Consistency Testing**  
  - Conducted using Python (`SciPy`) and Excel.
  - Measures alignment between **qualitative reviews** and **quantitative scores**.
  - Highlights discrepancies and offers data-driven grading insights.


## Tools & Libraries

- Python (NLTK, Gensim, SciPy, pandas, sklearn)
- Excel (for tabular analysis and visualization, which is not included here)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory data analysis)
